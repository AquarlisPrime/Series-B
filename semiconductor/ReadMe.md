This repository contains an implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using TensorFlow/Keras for predicting band gap properties in a dataset of condensed binary 2D geometries.

## Overview

The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model implemented here is designed to predict the band gap location and width based on the features extracted from condensed binary 2D geometries. It leverages a custom loss function that combines reconstruction loss (MSE) and KL divergence to optimize model performance. The project also includes utilities for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and geometry generation based on desired band gap properties.

## Features

- **Data Handling:** Synthetically generated dataset (`X_data`, `y_location`, `y_width`) for training and testing.
- **Normalization:** Standardization of input features and target variables using `StandardScaler`.
- **Model Architecture:** Encoder-decoder architecture with dropout and batch normalization for regularization and stability.
- **Loss Function:** Custom VAE loss function integrating reconstruction loss and KL divergence.
- **Training Strategies:** Early stopping, learning rate reduction, and cyclical learning rate scheduling to enhance training efficiency and avoid overfitting.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Computes MSE, MAE, SSIM, and PSNR to evaluate model accuracy and image quality.
- **Geometry Generation:** Functionality to generate new geometries based on specified band gap properties.

## Setup

To run the code, ensure you have Python 3.x and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-image tensorflow matplotlib
```

## Usage

### Training the VAE:

1. Modify parameters like `data_size`, `latent_dim`, and `intermediate_dim` as needed.
2. Run the script to train the VAE and evaluate on the test set.

### Generating New Geometries:

Use the `generate_geometry` function to create new geometries based on desired band gap properties.

### Visualization:

Adjust plotting parameters in `matplotlib` to visualize generated geometries as needed.

## Implications in Industry

The use of VAEs in predicting band gap properties in condensed binary 2D geometries has significant implications in several industries:

- **Materials Science:** Accelerates the discovery and optimization of new materials with specific electronic properties.
- **Semiconductor Industry:** Facilitates the design of semiconductor materials with tailored band gaps for improved performance.
- **Nanotechnology:** Enables precise control over nanostructure properties critical for various applications, including sensors and energy devices.

## Advantages

- **Data Efficiency:** VAEs can handle high-dimensional data efficiently, reducing the need for extensive labeled datasets.
- **Generative Capability:** Beyond prediction, VAEs can generate new geometries corresponding to desired band gap properties, supporting inverse design approaches.
- **Regularization:** Incorporates dropout and batch normalization for improved model generalization and stability.

## Example

```python
# Example: Generate geometry for given band gap properties
band_gap_location_example = 0.5
band_gap_width_example = 0.1
new_geometry = generate_geometry(band_gap_location_example, band_gap_width_example)

# Plot generated geometry
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(new_geometry.flatten(), marker='o')
plt.title('Generated Geometry (Line Plot)')
plt.xlabel('Index')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
